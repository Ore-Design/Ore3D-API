## Overview

The **Ore3D API** is a public repository designed to facilitate manufacturers and contractors in creating integrations with the proprietary Configure, Price, and Quote (CPQ) software, **Ore3D**. Developed by Ore Designs, Ore3D offers a versatile platform for generating sophisticated quotes, managing manufacturing workflows, and streamlining project collaboration.

With an active Ore3D subscription, users gain the capability to craft their own plugins using this API, extending the functionality of Ore3D according to their specific needs.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Ore3D API, follow these steps:

1. **Add Repository to your Project:**
   JitPack is used to host the public repository. Make sure that you have the repository source listed in your package manager.

   Gradle:
   ```bash
   repositories {
      mavenCentral()
      maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
   }
   ```
   Maven:
   ```bash
   <repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
   ```

   Then add the API to your project dependancies.

   Gradle:
   ```bash
   dependencies
   {
      implementation 'com.github.Ore-Design:Ore3D-API:2.0.4.0'
